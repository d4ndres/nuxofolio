      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I use my passion and skills to build products and experiences.
        <br/>
        I've been currently working for Helexium and freelancing on small projects in my free time. 
        <br/>
        I have experience with various programming languages and specifically web technologies.
        <br/>
        My motivation for developing this website is to share my learnings with the rest of the world.
        <br/>
        Along with developing software, I enjoy traveling, going to live music events, discovering something new, and hanging out with my friends.
